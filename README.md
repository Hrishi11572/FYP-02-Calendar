# FYP-02-Calendar
Second Project : Calendar , built using c language .
This is a very interesting project which inputs the year and desired month from the user and outputs the calendar for the month.
It then goes a step ahead to ask if the user wants to navigate forwards , backwards , exit from the calendar .
The project utilises the basics of zeller's congtuence algorithm and C .
